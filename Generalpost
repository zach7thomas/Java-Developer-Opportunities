==========================================

I'll use this repository to post software development positions that are open in the DFW area.

Typically if a specific post is up, that specific job is open. I am always looking for developer, but not limited to just that. I am open to helping anyone looking for opportunities. 

There are many opportunities availble in the DFW area so please feel free to reach  at zthomas@teksystems.com 

Best,
Zachary J. Thomas
